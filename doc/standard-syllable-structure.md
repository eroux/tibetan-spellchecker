## Standard Tibetan Syllable Structure

This document is an addendum / errata to [@Hildt2018](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/70z8069f), which should be read first.

### Additional affix combinations

In section *2.2.8 Constraints on affixed particles*, the article states that the only combination of affixes is `འིའོ`, but the Kangyur and Tengyur contain other combinations, particularly `འིའམ`. After discussing with grammar teachers, it seems the following combinations, although unlikely, would be correct:

- `འིའོ`
- `འིའམ`
- `འིའང`
- `འོའམ`
- `འོའང`
- `འིའོའམ`
- `འིའོའང`

Note that these new particles do not affect the syllable decomposition algorithm described in section *3 Decomposing a syllable*.
